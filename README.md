### Requirements Implemented for Creative Mode

## Requirement 4: C4 Bomb

Souls can be traded by the Player to buy a new item called C4 Bomb through the Vendor. The price of the C4 Bomb 
will be 300 souls. The player can place the bomb anywhere on the map(as long as the Player can enter that area).
Once the Player drops the bomb, it will take 2 turns before the bomb explodes and causes damage to the surrounding 
area that is within 3 squares away. The damage caused by the bomb will be 50 hit points. The bomb can only be used 
once and, it will be removed from the map after it has been used.



## Requirement 5:  Invisibility

Souls can be traded by the Player to buy a new item called invisibility cloak which makes the Player invisible 
to enemies. The price of the invisibility cloak will be 200 Souls. The Player can equip the cloak anytime. If the 
invisible cloak is used, the player will be invisible in the map, enemies will stop attacking the player if they are 
already attacking, and continue its wandering behaviour. If no enemy is attacking player, enemies will ignore the 
presence of the player even if player is nearby.
